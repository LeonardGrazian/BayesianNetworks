## Roadmap
* Implement remaining functionality of binary bayesian network
* Refactor bbn code to abstract away specific quirks of binary networks
  * If it helps, implement an N-ary bayesian network
* Using generalized bbn code, create template class for general directed nets
* Implement new node types as needed
* Apply library to some lightweight applications
* Benchmark compute and identify resource bottlenecks
* Optimize code for resource consumption and usability
## Misc TODOs
* Get latent learning working
* Refactor code into a python package
  * Organize tests into a directory
  * (Publish to some repo for easy deployment to cloud?)
* More tests
  * Test larger, more complex networks
  * Improve test coverage of current sized networks (i.e. test all the nodes)
* Start a basic undirected graphical model implementation
